      Create an Express project which uses WebPack to create client files.
      Add this file to your <code>static</code> directory.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="email_list.html">http://cs.harding.edu/gfoust/classes/comp431/email_list.html</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Look at the HTML source.  Notice it includes a file
      named <code>jquery.js</code> and a file
      named <code>email_list.js</code>, both from the <code>/lib</code>
      directory.  These files will be created by WebPack.  The
      file <code>jquery.js</code> is the commons chunk for jQuery, and the
      file <code>email_list.js</code> is the one you will write for this
      assignment.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may not make any changes to the HTML file.

        When the user submits the form (either by clicking on the
        &ldquo;Add&rdquo; button or by pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd>) then you
        should add a new row to the end of the table with
        id <code>users</code> which contains the following three cells:
        <ul>
          <li>The value from the name text box</li>
          <li>The value from the email text box</li>
          <li>Three links (described below)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        The three links should be as follows:
        <ul>
          <li>
            An up-arrow link (<code>&amp;uarr;</code>)
            with <code>class="up"</code>
          </li>
          <li>
            A down-arrow link (<code>&amp;darr;</code>)
            with <code>class="down"</code>
          </li>
          <li>
            An delete link (<code>X</code>) with <code>class="rem"</code>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        When you click on the up-arrow link, the corresponding row should move
        up by one in the table unless it is already at the top.
      </li>
      <li>
        When you click on the down-arrow link, the corresponding row should
        move down by one in the table unless it is already at the bottom.
      </li>
      <li>
        When you click on the delete link, the corresponding row should be
        removed from the table.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Here is an example of what the table would look like after adding a few
      rows to it.
